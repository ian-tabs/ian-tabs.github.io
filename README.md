# Welcome to the main repository of my GitHub Pages.

## _(under construction)_

This project is (~~going to be~~) a simple dynamic directory of all my repositories and other contributions. The goal was (~~is~~) to keep dependencies minimal and for it to need minimal maintenance.

I started (~~am~~) working on this project to learn new development tools; e.g. TypeScript & WebPack. I chose to not use a framework to exercise writing modular and utilize the fundamentals.

Check out the other cool stuff that I'm working on [here](https://ian-tabs.github.io/).

Dont forget to say 'Hi' to **_jenny.ts_** from **_src/scripts-ts_** before you go!
