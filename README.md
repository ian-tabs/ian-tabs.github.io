# The main repository of my GitHub Pages.

### _(under construction)_

I decided to make the Homepage to be a simple & dynamic directory of all of my public repositories & contributions.

I started this repository to learn new development tools that allows building more effectively; e.g. TypeScript, WebPack, & other npm packages.

For this project, I refrained from using a framework to exercise writing modular at the lowest level & further utilize the fundamentals of software design & architecture.

Check out the page & other cool stuff that I'm working on [here](https://ian-tabs.github.io/)!! 

## But before you go...

Dont forget to say 'Hi' to **_jenny.ts_** from **_src/scripts-ts_**. She works hard on creating the modules displayed to people visiting the page.

I hope you enjoy reading and reviewing my work as much as I did while I was writing it!
