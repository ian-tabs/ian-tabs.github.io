# The main repository of my GitHub Pages.

## _(under construction)_

This project is a simple dynamic directory of all my repositories and other contributions.

I started this repository to learn new development tools that allows building more effectively; e.g. TypeScript, WebPack, & more.

I refrained from using a framework to exercise writing modular and further utilize the fundamentals of software design.

Check out other cool stuff that I'm working on [here](https://ian-tabs.github.io/)!!

Dont forget to say 'Hi' to **_jenny.ts_** from **_src/scripts-ts_** before you go.
